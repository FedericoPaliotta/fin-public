## components of a bond


bond is essentially a way to peg your interest rate at
a certain value.. given you trust the company.

federal 30 year bonds are special for some reason.

- face/par value
  the dollar amount that the bond was issued for.
  this is the amount that the coupon applies to and the
  amount that is returned at maturiy

- whats a coupon
  the % return on the face value

- whats a term
  the years after which the bond matures

- market value of a bond
  affected by how close you are to the term rate

  interest rate up      ->    bond down
  interest rate down    ->    bond up

so if you buy high rate bonds, and you expect the
interest rates to go down, then you can sell the bonds
at a huge profit.
