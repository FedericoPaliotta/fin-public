## how to value a bond and yield to maturity

- simple interest
  coupon yield = 1 year coupon yield / par value   ex. 50/1000 = 5%
  current yield = 1 year coupon yield / price paid

- compound interest
  reinvesting the money can compound the investment

  yield to maturity = combines simple interest, compount interest, current yield

- current yield
  current yield = 1 year coupon yield / price paid

  for bonds that are bought afterwards. depending on if you paid more or less
    than the par value, at maturity you will either lose or gain the difference


- yield to maturity
  yield to maturity = combines simple interest, compount interest, current yield
