## balance sheet and margin of saftey

a business has 3 pieces of paperwork:
- income statement
- balance sheet
- cash flow statement


income statement: (used to find a company's profit)
  company = net income
  share = earnings
  net income = total revenue - cost of revenue - taxes


balance sheet: (used to find the margin of safety)
  company = equity
  share = book value
  what is a company worth if you try to liquidate the business right now

  equity = assets - libalities

  *margin of safety*: equity - market price (share price).
  the closer that the market price is to the equity, the safer the investment

cash flow: (used to find out how cash is spent in the business)
