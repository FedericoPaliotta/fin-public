## what is a bond


- what is a bond
its nothing more than a loan

mission is to come up with $500 million

create 500,000 bonds
par value = $1000/bond
term = 30 years
coupon rate = 5%

bank will sell the bond for $1005 per bond to investors

bond is paid 2 times a year. so 5% of $1000 is $50. so they get $25

at the end of the 30 years they get the par value back of $1000


- who uses bonds
government and cooprporation
federal bond is 0 risk because they can simply print more money to fullfil payment

- bond risk
the company's situation (can they still make the payments)
interest rate changes: depending on what the interest rate in the market is
inflation: profit is the coupon rate - inflation rate

if the compnay goes bankrupt they pay:
  bond first
  perferred share
  common share

- why is bond investing lucrative
when the P/E is high(low returns) then it is likely that the
bond coupon(return rate) is high.

when stock are trading high, bond might have a good coupon rate.
