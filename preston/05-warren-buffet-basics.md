  - company must be managed by vigiliant leaders (company must have low debt)
  - stock must be undervalued

- WB valuation technique
  when P/E is low and return in high, then you can expect the margin of
      safety to be worse.

  P(price)/book value(BV) = (lets assume 14.3) for ever $14.3 you spend you
      will have $1 of equity in the business.


price to earning                   price to book value
------------------------------------------------------------------
P/E = 25    Return = 4%            P/BV = 3      Safety = 33%
P/E = 20    Return = 5%            P/BV = 2      Safety = 50%
    --------------- we want below this line ------------
P/E = 15    Return = 6.6%          P/BV = 1.5    Safety = 67%
P/E = 10    Return = 10%           P/BV = 1     Safety = 100%
P/E = 5     Return = 20%           P/BV = .7     Safety = 143%

15 * 1.5 = *22.5* so we are intesrested in a company that
has multiplier of 22.5 or lower
