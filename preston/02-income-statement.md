## value a small business

100 total revenue: is what comes in
70 cost of revenue: money required to run the business
10 taxes

*net income* or *earning* is therefore: 100 - 70 - 10 = 20

the net income can either be used to
  pay owners: divident
  put back into the business: add equity


if you overpay for stock then your return will go down.
this is why its so important to figure out what a stock is worth.
